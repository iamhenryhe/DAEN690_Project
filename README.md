This report introduces an enhanced solution for Allwyn Corporation to improve their proposal development method, which demands lengthy manual hours to gather historic data and case studies. To solve this problem, we propose an automated Generative AI Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot system that retrieves data automatically, allowing users to quickly access past proposals and performance statistics. In this study, the implementation of a scalable, serverless chatbot that makes use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) to accomplish these goals is described in detail, as are the efforts that were made to achieve them. The main purpose of this study is to reduce the extensive manual effort made to retrieve past performance data and proposals.
